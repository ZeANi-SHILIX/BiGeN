## Overview
The Smart Traffic Obsorvation & Prediction(STOP) project is an AI-based system designed to accurately identify and interpret traffic signs in real-time. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, STOP reduces the risks associated with manual recognition, enhancing road safety.

## Key Features
- Real-time identification and interpretation of traffic signs.
- High accuracy in classifying various types of signs.
- Easy integration into existing driver assistance systems.
- Extensible and customizable for future development.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies

## Usage
1. Run the main script: `python main.py`
2. Follow the instructions for capturing or providing input images.
3. The system will output the recognized traffic signs and their meanings.

## Dataset
The STOP project was trained on a comprehensive dataset of labeled traffic sign images, ensuring robust performance across various scenarios. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size, but it can be obtained from [link to dataset].

## Future Development
- Integration with real-time video analysis for continuous recognition.
- Enhancement of model performance through advanced CNN architectures.
- Integration with navigation systems for improved driver assistance.


## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to the contributors and mentors who have supported the STOP project.
